"""An R2R source must hold real weights before it broadcasts them.

The controller chooses the R2R source from
``weights_loaded_in_view_of_command``, which records that a P2R was *published*
and is never cleared when one fails.  ``WeightSyncThread._run`` turns a failed
P2R into a log line and then executes the next queued command, so the source
would go on to broadcast a buffer that was never seeded.  Every destination
accepts it, sets the sticky ``weight_synced`` bit, and generates against base
weights while reporting the current version -- silently.

These tests pin the guard that stops it, and the cancellation path that keeps
the peers from paying the 120 s barrier timeout plus a full
``COSMOS_NCCL_TIMEOUT_MS`` inside ``ncclBroadcast``.
