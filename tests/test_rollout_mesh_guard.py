"""The rollout global mesh must not commit to a collective it cannot finish.

``ncclCommInitRank`` is a collective over a fixed membership snapshot, and the
rebuild that calls it is triggered BY membership changing.  If any member of
the snapshot departs before reaching its own call, every survivor blocks in the
collective -- alive, still heartbeating, with the GIL released so no signal
handler runs.  A whole allocation is lost with no error and no traceback.

Three defences are covered here:

* the collective is skipped when the job can never use it -- decided by the
  CONTROLLER and carried on the command, because the same predicate evaluated
  independently per worker can disagree, and a collective that only some ranks
  enter is itself the hang;
* mesh RANKS are still assigned either way, because data dispatch reads them;
* when the collective is built, the wait is bounded and the resulting error
  names the membership it was waiting on.

The handler-registration cases exist because a previous revision of this fix
inserted a method between the ``@register_rollout_command_handler`` decorator
and ``build_global_mesh``, silently re-pointing ``BuildMeshCommand`` at the
wrong function.  Every behavioural test still passed, because they all call
``build_global_mesh`` directly and never go through the registry.
