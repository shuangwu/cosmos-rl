"""Async weight synchronization for disaggregated rollout workers.

This module implements an opt-in asynchronous weight sync path where P2R
(policy-to-rollout) and R2R (rollout-to-rollout) weight transfers execute
on a dedicated background thread with its own CUDA stream.  Weights are
written into a *buffer model* (a parameter-only clone) and copied to the
live model at explicit sync points -- either before each
``rollout_generation()`` call or before each policy inference call.

Architecture
------------

::

    Main thread                    WeightSyncThread
    ───────────                    ────────────────
    rollout_generation()           ← P2R/R2R commands from controller
      └─ sync_buffer_to_live()        └─ execute on weight_sync_stream
           copy buffer → live              write into buffer_state_dict
           (on inference_stream)           record CUDA event
                                           bump _buffer_version

Enabling
--------
Set ``[rollout].async_r2r_sync`` to ``"generation"`` or ``"inference"``
in the experiment config.  Default is ``"disabled"`` (synchronous path).

- ``generation``: sync buffer to live before each ``rollout_generation()``.
- ``inference``: additionally sync before each policy forward pass.

The ``[rollout].broadcast_all_params`` toggle (default ``false``) controls
whether R2R broadcasts all model parameters or only trainable ones.  Set
to ``true`` for models with non-trainable params that must be synced
(e.g. frozen vision encoders).
