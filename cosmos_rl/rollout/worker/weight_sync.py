"""Async weight synchronization for disaggregated rollout workers.

This module implements an opt-in asynchronous weight sync path where P2R
(policy-to-rollout) and R2R (rollout-to-rollout) weight transfers execute
on a dedicated background thread with its own CUDA stream.  Weights are
written into a *buffer model* (a parameter-only clone) and copied to the
live model at explicit sync points -- either before each
``rollout_generation()`` call or before each policy inference call.

Architecture
------------

::

    Main thread                    WeightSyncThread
    ───────────                    ────────────────
    rollout_generation()           ← P2R/R2R commands from controller
      └─ sync_buffer_to_live()        └─ execute on weight_sync_stream
           copy buffer → live              write into buffer_state_dict
           (on inference_stream)           record CUDA event
                                           bump _buffer_version

Enabling
--------
Set ``[rollout].async_r2r_sync`` to ``"generation"`` or ``"inference"``
in the experiment config.  Default is ``"disabled"`` (synchronous path).

- ``generation``: sync buffer to live before each ``rollout_generation()``.
- ``inference``: additionally sync before each policy forward pass.

The ``[rollout].broadcast_all_params`` toggle (default ``false``) controls
whether R2R broadcasts all model parameters or only trainable ones.  Set
to ``true`` for models with non-trainable params that must be synced
(e.g. frozen vision encoders).

    Raised on every participant, including the ones that were ready: the round
    did not happen.  It is terminal for the job.

    Nothing recovers a cancelled round.  Waiting for the next
    ``sync_weight_interval`` does not: the rollouts keep the pre-cancellation
    weights, so every prompt exceeds ``allowed_outdated_steps`` and is
    rejected, no rollouts are reported, and the trainer never reaches the next
    sync boundary -- the round that would break the cycle is gated behind the
    thing the cancelled round stopped.  On Slurm job 2142899 the last
    completed sync was step 6; the controller then logged "Soft throttle still
    engaged" 67 times, out to 195s, until the job was killed.

    Re-issuing the round does not either.  Retrying the same step needs its own
    rendezvous, because these Redis keys are step-scoped and the barrier
    counter is a monotonic INCR: on job 2143533 a second attempt kept
    incrementing the first one's counter, every arriver read a count already
    past the world size and declared itself the last worker -- 8/7 through 12/7
    inside one second, five workers each publishing its own go signal -- and
    the barrier stopped synchronising anything.  Rotating to a different source
    does not work either: the P2R protocol negotiates shard instructions per
    target, so a replica that has never been one starts from nothing.

    So the rollout workers are failed loudly instead, at the point where the
    cause is still attributable, rather than idling on a round that will never
    complete.  Note this does not by itself release the allocation: the policy
    hangs in its own teardown and never unregisters, so the controller's
    dead-policy escalation does not fire.  That is pre-existing (job 2142899
    behaves the same way without any of this) and is not addressed here.
