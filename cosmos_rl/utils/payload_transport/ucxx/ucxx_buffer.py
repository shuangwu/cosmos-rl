"""UCXX-based payload-transfer server / client.

UCX (and its Python binding UCXX) provides unified communication that
auto-optimizes the underlying transport:

* Same-node: shared-memory transport (~100 GB/s)
* Cross-node: RDMA (~12.5 GB/s) or TCP fallback

This module wraps :class:`SharedRingBuffer` with a UCXX server that
lets remote trainers read slot data directly from a worker's CPU
buffer without going through Redis.

The ``ucxx-cu12`` (or platform-equivalent) extra is **optional**.  When
it is not installed, importing this module still succeeds and
:data:`UCXX_AVAILABLE` is set to ``False``; attempts to start a server
or client will raise an explicit ``RuntimeError`` rather than failing
with an import error in random places.

        worker mirror the same SHM, so any thread can serve any slot;
        we exploit that symmetry for load balancing and failure
        recovery without ever splitting a single read across threads.

        **Port rotation and fallback.**

        1. *Per-call rotation.*  Successive calls advance a round-
           robin counter so traffic spreads evenly across all healthy
           server threads instead of always hammering
           ``available_ports[0]``.  Pure load balancing.
        2. *On-failure fallback.*  If a read completes with a transport-
           class error (endpoint reset, etc. -- see
           :data:`_PORT_ROTATABLE_ERRORS`), the offending port is
           quarantined for :data:`_PORT_QUARANTINE_SEC` and we retry
           once on the next port in rotation. A pending native request at the
           deadline is terminal, not a recoverable timeout: cancelling a Python
           future does not establish native completion. Clean stale-slot/server
           rejections propagate immediately without retry.

        ``timeout`` defaults to 5 s -- p99 happy-path read of a ~500
        MB slot is ~1 s on RDMA / shared memory, so 5 s is ample
        headroom. The budget applies to the entire attempt, not each await.

        Returns a dict of tensor name -> numpy view into a pinned CPU
        buffer.  The pinned backing tensor is stored under the
        ``_pinned_buf`` key and must be returned to the pool via
        :meth:`return_pinned` after the caller has copied data to GPU.
