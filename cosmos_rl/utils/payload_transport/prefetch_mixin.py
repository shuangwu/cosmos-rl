"""Transport-agnostic prefetch / double-buffer / early-train-ack mixin.

Background
----------
Heavy-payload transports (UCXX RDMA, NCCL point-to-point, …) all share
the same scheduling shape on the trainer side:

1. The rollout completion is a *reference* (a dict tag, an ``nccl:<id>``
   string, …) that must be resolved to actual tensors by an extra fetch.
2. Resolving N references in a batch is the slow step on each iteration.
3. The trainer can hide that latency by:
   * **prefetching** the next iteration's batch in the background
     while the current iteration's compute runs (pipeline overlap), and
   * **deferring** the wait until the *following* iteration so that
     ``step_training`` returns early and the rollout worker's train-ack
     fires sooner (early-ack, double-buffer).

That scheduling state machine has nothing to do with which transport is
moving the bytes -- only the actual fetch does.  This mixin owns the
scheduling and exposes a small set of subclass hooks for the transport
to plug into.

Subclass contract
-----------------
Concrete transport packers (``UCXXDataPackerMixin``,
``NCCLDataPackerMixin`` (future), …) inherit from this mixin and
override:

* :meth:`_should_intercept(rollout_output)` -- returns ``True`` if the
  rollout completion is a transport reference this mixin should resolve
  before delegating to the underlying packer.  Default: ``False``
  (everything passes straight through).
* :meth:`_cache_key(rollout_output)` -- returns a stable string key for
  the resolved payload.
* :meth:`_filter_prefetch_tasks(rollouts)` -- returns the subset of a
  rollout batch that should be prefetched as ``[(idx, ref), ...]``.
  Default: every rollout whose completion satisfies
  ``_should_intercept``.
* :meth:`_fetch_batch(tasks)` -- runs synchronously on the background
  thread; returns ``{cache_key: payload}``.  Must be implemented.
* :meth:`_sync_fetch(rollout_output)` -- blocking single-ref fallback
  used when ``get_policy_input`` hits a cache miss (e.g. when prefetch
  hasn't happened yet).  Default: ``None`` (skip episode).
* :meth:`_on_prefetch_complete(batch_id, n_results, fetch_ms)` -- hook
  for periodic stats logging.  Default: no-op.

The base mixin owns the queues / thread / state machine; subclasses own
the wire-format and the actual byte-moving.

Composition example
-------------------
::

    class UCXXMyDataPacker(UCXXDataPackerMixin, MyDataPacker):
        pass

    class NCCLMyDataPacker(NCCLDataPackerMixin, MyDataPacker):
        pass

The MRO ensures the mixin's ``get_policy_input`` runs first, intercepts
references, and only then delegates to ``MyDataPacker`` via ``super()``.

    See module docstring for the subclass-hook contract.

    Transport behaviour arrives one of two ways:

    * **Composed** -- attach a :class:`PayloadTransportStrategy` via
      :meth:`set_transport_strategy`.  The hooks below then delegate to it,
      which lets the transport be chosen from config at runtime.
    * **Subclassed** -- override the ``_``-prefixed hooks directly, the
      original contract.  Still fully supported.

    They are alternatives, not layers.  An override *replaces* the delegating
    implementation, so a subclass that overrides a hook wins for that hook even
    if a strategy is also attached; mixing the two on the same hook is
    therefore legal but almost never what you want.

        Ordering matters.  The worker only observes the shutdown event

        bounded by the transport's own (much larger) first-transfer / prefetch
        timeouts -- not by ``join_timeout``.  Joining first would therefore
        wait out a fetch that only the transport can unwedge.

        ``before_join`` runs after the event is set but BEFORE the join, so the
        transport can force its in-flight I/O to fail fast (NCCL
        ``comm_cache.abort_all``, UCXX client close).  The fetch then raises,
        the worker loop catches it, and the join completes promptly.  This
        mirrors the producer's ``cleanup_nccl``, which aborts comms *before*
        shutting down its sender pool for exactly this reason.

        When the thread does not exit within ``join_timeout`` its handle is
        deliberately RETAINED: it is still running and still reading
        ``self._prefetch_request_queue`` / ``self._prefetch_shutdown``, so
        :meth:`_setup_prefetch` must be able to see it and refuse to start a
