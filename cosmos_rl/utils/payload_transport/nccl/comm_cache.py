"""Lazy 2-rank NCCL communicator cache for payload transfer.

Rather than a global mesh or reusing weight-sync's static comm, payload
transfer builds a **2-rank communicator per ``(sender_rank,
receiver_rank)`` pair**, lazily, on first transfer between that pair, and
caches it.  This is elastic-friendly: a dead replica only forces
``nccl_abort`` on its own pair comms, never a global rebuild.

Scaling controls
----------------
Comm count is ``O(rollout_ranks × trainer_ranks)`` and each comm costs
tens of MB + a QP, so the cache enforces:

* **Consumer-driven pair set** — only pairs that actually transfer get a
  comm (the cache is populated lazily by the receiver).
* **Live-comm cap + LRU eviction** — at most ``max_live`` comms; the
  least-recently-used is aborted when the cap is exceeded.
* **Bounded concurrent init** — a semaphore caps simultaneous
  ``create_nccl_comm`` calls to avoid init storms when many pairs warm up
  at once.

Health-aware quarantine
--------------------------------
A transient NCCL error on a ``(sender_replica, sender_rank)`` endpoint
quarantines it with a cooldown: :meth:`is_quarantined` returns ``True``
until the cooldown expires, so the receiver drops/retries the episode
next round instead of wedging on a dead sender.  The cooldown map is the
shared :class:`~cosmos_rl.utils.payload_transport.rotation.HealthSkipList`
(the same helper UCXX's ``_port_skip_until`` rotation uses).

Testability
-----------
``build_fn`` / ``abort_fn`` are injectable, so the whole cache — LRU,
semaphore accounting, quarantine cooldown — is unit-testable on CPU with
fakes, without a CUDA context.
