"""NCCL payload transport, expressed as a composable strategy.

Holds everything about moving a trajectory GPU->GPU -- the Redis-backed
rendezvous, the communicator cache, the transfer streams, retry and quarantine
-- and nothing about *when* a fetch happens, which is the packer's job.

This is the code the 8-GPU Slurm run and the 2-rank e2e probe validated, moved
off ``NCCLDataPackerMixin`` unchanged apart from dropping the ``_nccl_dp_``
prefix (its state no longer shares a namespace with a packer) and taking the
iteration counter as an argument instead of reading it off one.
