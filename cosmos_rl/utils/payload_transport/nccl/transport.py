"""``PayloadTransport`` registration + control-plane cleanup for NCCL.

Background
----------
By default, Cosmos-RL transfers rollout completion payloads (token IDs,
log-probs, etc.) from rollout workers to the controller via Redis
streams.  For workloads with large payloads — such as VLA policies that
produce high-dimensional action tensors — the Redis path becomes a
bottleneck.

**NCCL payload transfer** is an opt-in alternative where the payload
tensors are sent directly between GPUs using NCCL point-to-point
operations.  Redis is still used as the *control plane*: receivers
publish per-transfer requests, senders acknowledge them, unique-IDs are
exchanged for lazy 2-rank communicators, and cleanup messages are sent
when stale transfers are discarded so the producer can free the GPU send
buffer immediately.

How it works (in-tree mixin path)
---------------------------------
1. A data packer that subclasses
   :class:`~cosmos_rl.utils.payload_transport.nccl.data_packer_mixin.NCCLDataPackerMixin`
   exposes ``_setup_nccl_data_packer``.  :meth:`attach_data_packer`
   invokes it with the worker's device, a live Redis client (built from
   ``redis_endpoint``), and the ``config.custom`` tunables.

2. Rollout completions transferred via NCCL have their ``completion``
   field prefixed with ``nccl:`` followed by a transfer ID.

3. When the controller discards outdated rollouts it dispatches to
   :meth:`NcclPayloadTransport.publish_cleanup_for_discarded` (via the
   registry) so the rollout worker's cleanup subscriber releases the
   associated GPU buffers immediately.

Legacy (deprecated) packer path
--------------------------------
Before the in-tree mixin existed, NCCL-aware packers exposed a
``redis_client`` attribute and an optional ``post_redis_injection()``
hook (PR #670 / commit 55745c).  :meth:`attach_data_packer` still honors
that contract as a **deprecated fallback** so downstream forks keep
working; new code should use the ``NCCLDataPackerMixin`` path.

Enabling
--------
Set ``[custom].payload_transfer = "nccl"`` in the experiment config.
The legacy ``[custom].nccl_payload_transfer = true`` boolean still works
as a deprecated alias.

           it is invoked with ``device``, a live Redis client, and the
           tunables resolved from ``config.custom``:

           * ``nccl_prefetch_timeout`` (float, default 30.0): per-batch
             wait ceiling for the prefetch worker's result queue.
           * ``nccl_read_max_attempts`` (int, default 2): total attempts
             per remote transfer (initial + transient retries).
           * ``nccl_recv_timeout`` (float, default 5.0): per-``nccl_recv``
             wall-clock budget (seconds) so a wedged sender engages
             retry / quarantine quickly.
           * ``nccl_first_transfer_timeout`` (float, default 30.0): larger
             budget for the FIRST (comm-creating) transfer of a pair, which
             must wait out the cold-start comm-init storm; floored at
             ``nccl_recv_timeout``.
           * ``nccl_receive_budget_bytes`` (int, default 0): opt-in device
             payload storage cap; requires explicit final-consumer release.
           * ``nccl_receive_admission_timeout`` (float, default 30.0): maximum
             wait for an older consumer to release budget capacity.

        2. **Composed** -- a packer that only schedules (exposes
           ``set_transport_strategy``) gets a strategy built and attached,
           which is how a transport can be chosen from config without
           subclassing a per-transport packer class.

        3. **Legacy fallback** (deprecated).  Packers exposing a
           ``redis_client`` attribute get a live client assigned followed
           by an optional ``post_redis_injection()`` call, in that order
           (PR #670 contract).  Superseded by the mixin path; retained
           only so in-flight downstream forks keep working.
