"""Pack a trajectory into the flat, schema-defined payload buffer.

Both producers write the same on-wire format -- a single contiguous ``uint8``
buffer whose field offsets come from :func:`~cosmos_rl.utils.trajectory.
schema_layout` -- and the consumer reads it back by schema alone, slicing at
``spec.nbytes`` and reinterpreting with ``spec.dtype``.  Keeping one
implementation of that loop is what makes the two ends agree.

Lives here rather than in :mod:`cosmos_rl.utils.trajectory` because it needs
torch, and that module is deliberately numpy-only so the transport-agnostic
scheduler can import it without pulling in a GPU stack.
