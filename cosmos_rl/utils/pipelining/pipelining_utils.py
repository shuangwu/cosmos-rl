    Generate a list of split points based on the input configs. In this function,
    the number of effective layers considered is the weighted summation of
    `num_moe_layers` and `num_dense_layers` where the weights are set to 1.0 for
    MoE layers and 0.5 for dense layers. We try to distribute all effective layers
    evenly onto the pipeline stages.

    The input modules (e.g., embedding tables, vision encoder) must always be
    assigned to stage 0 and the output modules (e.g., softmax) must always be
    assigned to stage `num_stages-1`.

    If schedule_str is a single-stage schedule, num_layers_per_stage must
    be set to None. We ensure that each pipeline rank has exactly 1 stage.
    If scheduler_str a multi-stage schedule, num_layers_per_stage must be
    set to a value >= 1.

    Args:
        schedule_str (str): The string of the schedule name.
        pp_size (int): Number of ranks assigned to the pipeline parallel dimension.
        num_layers_per_stage (int): The number of layers per (virtual) pipeline stage. Set this
            to >=1 only for multi-stage schedules. For single-stage schedules, the
            num_layers_per_stage is set internally to num_effective_layers // pp_size.
        num_moe_layers (int): The number of MoE layers in the model.
