"""The trajectory payload format: field names, flat byte schema, and layout.

A trajectory is defined by the **data packer** layer
(:class:`~cosmos_rl.dispatcher.data.packer.tensor_data_packer.TensorDataPacker`),
not by any transport -- transports only move the bytes.  But the packer sits
above ``utils`` in the layering (it imports ``dispatcher`` and ``policy.config``),
so the transports cannot import it.  Historically each side worked around that
by re-declaring the format: the field names existed in three places and the
episode-length resolution in three more, with only a comment ("Mirrored from
tensor_data_packer", "Matches the UCXX rollout mixin's schema") keeping them in
step.

This module is the single definition, placed low enough that both the packer
and every transport can depend on it.  Ownership is unchanged -- the packer
still defines what a trajectory *means*; it just no longer redeclares it.

The byte layout is a wire contract: the producer's pack and the consumer's
unpack must agree, and a run must be able to switch transports without
re-plumbing the payload.  Spec ORDER is therefore load-bearing.

Deliberately dependency-light (numpy only).  In particular it does NOT import
torch, so the transport-agnostic scheduler can use it without pulling in a GPU
stack; :func:`episode_length` duck-types tensor-likes via ``.item()``.
